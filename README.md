# Attributor.py

A prototype for a BBC News hack. The purpose is to provide journalists with a UI that allows them to upload an image that is intended to be used on any social media site. The script will generate appropiately different sized versions for each social media platform, and then add a BBC logo into the image.

To run the project git clone the repo, `cd` into the `dir` and then run...

```
python index.py
